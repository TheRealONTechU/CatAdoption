# Cat Adoption Mangagenment System (Capital One Hackathon 2018)

## The Challenge
To create a central management system for all cats that are under Toronto Cat Rescueâ€™s care

## Our Solution
Using a mySQL server to store all pertinent information about each of the foster carers, cats in the system and volunteers. Admins of the page are able to add people to view information in a tiered approch, such that all sensitive information is keep private. A common problem that arose with the old system was that there were far too many different sources of information, our centralized database would cut down on loss of data because the data is all interpreted from 3 tables of data, all interacting with php and HTML webpages.
